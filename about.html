					<h3>what inspired him</h3>
					<p>
						This might sound a bit off the books but i was just inspired by God if not him who, na baba God father of creation. And also my mum who is a fashion designer also and to my knowledge,
							she is the best, she stood by me all time and even corrected me when i made silly mistakes during my practice, she is a loving mother.
								Well sincerely i dint need to get inspired why? because its something i loved doing just like a God sent gift but i call it heritage from heaven it has to be given not earned.
								(proverb----- what ever you find yourself doing either small or big as long as it is what you love always d it well because you don't know who is watching).
